//! This library provides some functions that convert string cases between
//! camelCase, COBOL-CASE, kebab-case, MACRO_CASE, PascalCase, snake_case and
//! Train-Case.
//! And this library also provides a trait `Caser` which makes strings enable
//! to convert their cases by their own methods.
//!
//! Basically, these functions targets the upper and lower cases of only ASCII
//! alphabets for capitalization, and all characters except ASCII alphabets and
//! ASCII numbers are eliminated as word separators.
//!
//! To limit characters using as separators, the functions named like
//! `*_with_sep` are provided, and to keep specified characters, the functions
//! named like `*_with_keep` are provided.
//!
//! In this crate, the default behavior of the conversion functions is to insert
//! a separator after a sequence of numbers and symbols, but not before them.
//! (For example, `snake_case("abc123def") ==> "abc123_def"`)
//! However, for cases where you want to insert a separator before the sequence
//! as well, the functions names like `*_with_nums_as_word` are provided.
//! (For example, `snake_case_with_nums_as_word("abc123def") ==> "abc_123_def"`)
//!
//!
//! ## Install
//!
//! In `Cargo.toml`, write this crate as a dependency.
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! stringcase = "0.3.0"
//! ```
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! The function contained in this crate are executed as follows:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use stringcase::camel_case;
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     let input = "foo-bar-baz";
//!     let camel = camel_case(input);
//!     assert_eq!(camel, "fooBarBaz");
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! And by bringing `Caser` with `use` declaration, it will be able to execute
//! methods of strings, `String` or `&str`, to convert their cases.
//!
//! ```rust
//! use stringcase::Caser;
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     let input = "foo-bar-baz";
//!     let camel = input.to_camel_case();
//!     assert_eq!(camel, "fooBarBaz");
//! }
//! ```
